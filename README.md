# SMS-Spam-Detection-Project
Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of a SMS Spam Detection system using a Logistic Regression model. The goal is to automatically classify incoming SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content.

Prerequisites

Jupyter Notebook: Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the provided notebook. You can install it using the following command:

     pip install notebook
     
Python: The project is implemented in Python. Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed (Python 3.x is recommended).

Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries by running:

    pip install pandas scikit-learn

Project Structure

sms_spam_detection.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main implementation of the SMS Spam Detection model. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. Make sure to place the dataset file (sms_spam_dataset.csv or similar) in this folder.

Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:
 
     cd Sms-Spam-Detection-Project

Start Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook
Open the sms_spam_detection.ipynb notebook in your browser and execute the cells sequentially.

Ensure the dataset file is in the data/ directory or update the notebook to point to the correct file path.

Dataset

The project utilizes the "sms_spam_dataset.csv" dataset, which contains labeled SMS messages. The dataset is included in the data/ directory.

Model

The implemented model uses Logistic Regression for binary classification of SMS messages into spam or ham.

Results

The notebook provides details on model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Make sure to review these metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
